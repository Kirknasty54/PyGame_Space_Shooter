<h1>PyGame_Space_Shooter</h1>

This project uses Tech with Tim's 'Pygame Tutorial - Creating Space Invaders' video as a starting point. You can see that video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-__8Xw9KTM

I decided to use his video as a jumping off point as it seemed simple enough to try and add my own features but not too difficult that I would be pulling hair out over it, turns out I was wrong ;). This has been really my first 'independent' project (independent 
in the sense that I wasn't watching a professor create a game and doing it right alongside him and having to turn it in for a grade), so I hope it turns out all right. 

I just decided to add some 'quality of life features', if you wanna word it like that, to make it feel more like a full fledged game. Things like a main menu, pause menu, upgrades, enemy variation (in terms of health, attack speed, attack damage, etc), bosses, etc.
Might possibly add a co-op to this, wouldn't hurt to practice some net code so I can hopefully finally get a job/internship :). Actively working on this project so if everything mentioned isn't quite in here yet, thats why.
